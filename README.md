# landing-page
Following The Odin Project, I will be creating a landing page.

For this landing page I will be creating a page about myself and some of the main exercises I currently do in the gym. As of writing this README.md file I am following the StrongLifts 5x5 program, I am thinking about changing to the Greyskull LP (GSLP) program instead as I wish to target my upper body more instead of my lower body.

Within this project I will be demonstrating my skills that I have learnt up until this point. They are including but not limited to -

* CSS
* HTML
* Flexbox

I find Flexbox extremely powerful and easy to use and I am keen to start.

I worry this may take me a while as I have had a 5 month hiatus between now and since I last openned TOP. Hopefully its muscle memory coming back to me.
